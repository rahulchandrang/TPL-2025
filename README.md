# Tide Dynamic Pricing Model

## Overview
The Tide Dynamic Pricing Model project aims to develop a machine learning model that optimizes pricing strategies based on various factors such as demand, competition, and customer behavior. This project utilizes AI-assisted development tools to streamline the machine learning development pipeline.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data files.
  - **raw/**: Directory for raw data files used for training and testing.
  - **processed/**: Directory for processed data files ready for analysis and modeling.
  - **README.md**: Documentation on the data structure, sources, and preprocessing steps.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
  - **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**: Notebook for visualizing data distributions and understanding feature relationships.

- **src/**: Source code for the project.
  - **config/**: Configuration settings for the project.
    - **config.yaml**: YAML file with paths to data, model parameters, and environment-specific settings.
  - **data/**: Data loading functionality.
    - **data_loader.py**: Class for loading raw and processed datasets.
  - **features/**: Feature engineering functionality.
    - **feature_engineering.py**: Function for creating features from raw data.
  - **models/**: Model definition and training.
    - **model.py**: Class for the dynamic pricing model.
    - **train.py**: Training pipeline for the model.
  - **evaluation/**: Model evaluation functionality.
    - **evaluate.py**: Function for evaluating model performance.

    - **helpers.py**: Various helper functions for data preprocessing and logging.

- **tests/**: Unit tests for the project.
  - **test_data_loader.py**: Tests for the DataLoader class.
  - **test_feature_engineering.py**: Tests for feature engineering functions.
  - **test_model.py**: Tests for the DynamicPricingModel class.
  - **test_evaluate.py**: Tests for evaluation functions.

- **scripts/**: Automation scripts for training and inference.
  - **run_training.sh**: Shell script to automate the training process.
  - **run_inference.sh**: Shell script to automate the inference process.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

- **.env.example**: Example of environment variables needed for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tide-dynamic-pricing-ml
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and modifying as needed.

## Usage Guidelines
- To run the training process, execute the following command:
  ```
  ./scripts/run_training.sh
  ```

- To make predictions using the trained model, execute:
  ```
  ./scripts/run_inference.sh
  ```
